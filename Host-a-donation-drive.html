        <h1>Keys to a Successful Blood Drive</h1>
    </div>
    <p>The key to a successful blood drive is to be organized and get creative! Your BDC Account Manager is your best
     source for ideas and information to promote your event.</p>

<h4>Here are some ideas to help:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Assemble a blood drive committee to help recruit donors and give support on the day of the blood drive.</li>
<li>Work with your Account Manager to determine appointment goals and be ready to sign up donors for appointments.</li>
<li>Four to five weeks prior to the blood drive, put up posters and other promotional materials.</li>
<li>Three weeks prior to the blood drive, use your newsletter, newspaper or website to promote the blood drive.</li>
<li>Two weeks before the blood drive, keep everyone updated with announcements, texts or emails.</li>
<li>In the days prior to the blood drive, make calls or emails to remind donors of their appointments.</li>
<li>After the blood drive, be sure to say “thank you” to all participants. </li>
<li>Share the success by writing an article for your newsletter, newspaper or website with pictures from the blood drive.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Additional ideas for high schools: </h4>
<ul>
<li>Make announcements at school functions.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to ask teachers, staff and parents to sign up to donate at the blood drive.</li>
<li>Hold a special assembly two to five days before the blood drive. BDC can provide a speaker who has received a </li>
<li>blood transfusion and is willing to share his or her story.</li>
<li>Place sign-up tables in high traffic areas. When appointments are made, people are more likely to donate at the </li>
<li>blood drive. Appointments also keep the blood drive moving smoothly.</li>
<li>Create a challenge between different student groups in your school or other schools in your area.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Remember: The best way to ask people to donate is face to face! </h4>
<p>Ask with confidence and enthusiasm. Studies show 
that the primary reason people don’t donate blood is because no one ever asked!</p>
